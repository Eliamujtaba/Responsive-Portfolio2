        <br>My Name is Mujtaba Elia. It is two years i am imagrated from Afghanistan to the United States
        <br> I got my bachelor degree in cinema at Kabul University, Fine Art Faculty. When i moved to the US,
        <br> i found out that it is to hard to work in cinema feild in the Unite States. that requires alot of
        <br> money. After film directory, i always had intrest in computer science. First i started learning ESL
        <br> in ARC comunity college. I found out that if i continue in ARC, it will take more than 5 years to
        <br> get my bachelor degree in computer science. Because i need to learn English language first an than
        <br> i can start my major. I was looking for a short tearm course which can teach me programing. Finally
        <br> i found UC Davis Extension Boot Camps. I started learning programing in US Davis Extension to reach
        <br> my goal and I wish to find a good job after I graduated.
